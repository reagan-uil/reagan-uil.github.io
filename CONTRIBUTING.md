# Contributing
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Our Software
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. We use pnpm as our package manager.

## To start:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Do your magic!
3. Build your code and make sure everything works.
4. Lint and format your code.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/reagan-uil/reagan-uil.github.io/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/reagan-uil/reagan-uil.github.io/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce - be specific!
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* Use 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* run `pnpm run format` to format your code
