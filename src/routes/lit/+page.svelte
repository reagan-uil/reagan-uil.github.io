      <p>
        Literary Criticism is about analyzing famous literary works and
        knowledge of literary terms & history. The contest has a section for
        literary terms+history, a section on questions from the annual UIL
        Reading List (Fiction, Poetry, Drama), a section on criticizing, and a
        tiebreaking essay.
