    <About>
      <p>
        Spelling in UIL is not exactly your typical Spelling Bee anymore, rather
        having several twists. The first part of the spelling test has
        proofreading and vocab: identify misspelled words and fill in blanks
        with the proper choice. The other questions, as well as the tiebreaker,
        are like a written spelling bee: hear the word and its definition and
        spell it accordingly. UIL's Word Power changes every year, so make sure
        to find the latest one on the UIL site.
