    <About>
      <p>
        This competition is quite literally the definition of speed. Number
        Sense is a test of quickly solving math problems, and even better you
        don't get to use a calculator, write down work, or change your answers!!
        All calculations have to be done manually, but of course with such a
        daunting contest there's a huge load of tricks to guide competitors
        along the way. Although doing 80 questions in 10 minutes seems very
        daunting, very few people finish all the questions within the time
        limit, and many still place high without it.

      <ul>
        <li>80 questions</li>
        <li>10 minutes</li>
        <li>Scoring:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>+5 for a right answer</li>
          <li>-4 for a wrong answer</li>
          <li>
            -4 for skipping a question (not answering a question before the last
            attempted)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Only mental math allowed i.e. scratch work or calculators will get you
          DQed
        </li>
        <li>
          Must write all answers with a blue ink pen, and no changing answers (a
