		<About>
			<p>
				UIL's Computer Science competition is actually split into two parts. The
				written test is a mostly-MCQ test that assesses a contestant's ability
				to analyze and predict a code's output, alongside testing other general
				techniques such as two's complement, digital expressions, and graph
				theory. Although changing since the competition's introduction, UIL has
				utilized Java as the official language since the 2004 season.
			</p>
			<p>
				The other part is actually a team competition: programming! Although one
				can compete in CS individually and advance to even state, the
				programming section must be a team of 3. These three people work
				together on a single laptop to solve a series of problems within the
				two-hour limit. Each problem has a set point value, which decreases for
				wrong submissions, and typically range from basic printing to the
				equivalent of some USACO Gold & Platinum topics. Like the written,
				programming only allows competitors to use Java.
