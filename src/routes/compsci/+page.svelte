    <About>
      <p>
        UIL's Computer Science competition is actually split into two parts. The
        written test is a mostly-MCQ test that assesses a contestant's ability
        to analyze and predict a code's output, alongside testing other general
        techniques such as two's complement, digital expressions, and graph
        theory. Although changing since the competition's introduction, UIL has
        utilized Java as the official language since the 2004 season.
      </p>

        The other part is actually a team competition: programming! Although one
        can compete in CS individually and advance to even state, the
        programming section must be a team of 3. These three people work
        together on a single laptop to solve a series of problems within the
        two-hour limit. Each problem has a set point value, which decreases for
        wrong submissions, and typically range from basic printing to the
        equivalent of some USACO Gold & Platinum topics. Like the written,
        programming only allows competitors to use Java.
