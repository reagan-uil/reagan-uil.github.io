      <p>
        As the name might suggest, this competition revolves a lot around
        calculators. Calculator's a competition that basically tests both your
        typing speed and your problem solving skills. Half of the 70 questions
        are Number Crunchers, aka "type equation into calculator and write
        answer", while the other half constitutes of word problems or geometry
        problems to solve with the aid of a calculator.
